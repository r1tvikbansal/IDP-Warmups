This dataset has many columns which we will not attempt to understand, but you can look at them [here](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/mushroom-classification#mushrooms.csv) if you are interested. The columns of interest will be our target `class` which takes on values `e` for edible or `p` for poisonous. All the features we will use (explained below) are categorical. Some value are missing so we will need to handle that.\n","\n","\n","For this task, we will use only a subset of the columns for prediction. You should use the columns `cap-shape`, `cap-surface`, `cap-color` as features and `class` as the target. All other columns should be ignored for this analysis.\n","\n","In this problem, you should follow the machine learning pipeline to do the following steps:\n","* Drop all columns that are not relevant to the analysis.\n","* Remove all rows that have missing values for the columns of interest. There is no need to throw out rows that have missing values outside of these 4 columns (since those missing values will not be included in the model).\n","* Separate the data into *usable* features and labels.\n","* Split the dataset into 70% training data and 30% test data.\n","* Train a decision tree model on the data.\n","* Evaluate the models training and test accuracy.\n","\n","Remember to import any thing you need from `pandas` or `sklearn`!\n","\n","## Problem 0: Load the Data\n","Load in the dataset into a `DataFrame` named `data`.
