# Practice: Save and Load a Shopping List

You are working on a simple shopping list app, and you want to save the user's shopping list to a file so it can be retrieved later. Your task is to use Python's pickle module to achieve this.


## Student Instructions:
- Open and examine "pickling.py" and "test_behavior.py"
- Complete the save_shopping_list function:
  - Use pickle to save the shopping_list to the specified file.
- Complete the load_shopping_list function:
  - Use pickle to retrieve the shopping list from the file.
- Test the code:
  - Run either run_tests.py or use the test tab in VS code to run the test to confirm that the "Loaded shopping list" printed at the end matches the original shopping list.
- Go to visual studio extensions and add the extension "binary viewer"
- Right click on the file you saved and "Open as hexadecimal view"
- What do you think you are seeing here? Can you explain it? Let's discuss as a class.
